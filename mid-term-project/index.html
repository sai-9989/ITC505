    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
      In this mid-term project, I created an interactive Power Rangers-themed “Choose Your Own Adventure” game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
      I designed a branching storyline with eight unique endings, each represented by different images to make the experience engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      I planned the flow using a simple chart, ensuring every choice led to a new stage or an ending. Each story stage was represented as an 
      object in JavaScript, which helped keep the logic organized and easier to debug. DOM manipulation and event listeners were used to update 
      the story and image dynamically based on user input.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge was managing transitions between stages and ensuring the story didn’t break at any choice. I overcame this by 
      testing each branch and carefully matching the “next” keys in the JavaScript story objects. I also learned how to better structure 
      dynamic web content using reusable functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project strengthened my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive and visually appealing 
      web applications.
