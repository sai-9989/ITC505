            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                William Shakespeare is regarded as one of the greatest playwrights in history.
                Among his many works, his tragedies stand out for their deep exploration of
                human flaws, fate, and ambition. Works such as <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>,
                <em>Othello</em>, and <em>King Lear</em> have been studied for centuries due
                to their universal themes.
            </p>

            <h2>Hamlet: The Struggle with Inaction</h2>
            <p>
                In <em>Hamlet</em>, Shakespeare explores the dangers of hesitation and
                indecision. Hamlet’s delay in avenging his father’s death reveals the destructive
                power of excessive reflection. His tragic flaw—indecision—ultimately leads to
                widespread death and the collapse of Denmark’s royal family.
            </p>

            <h2>Macbeth: Ambition and Power</h2>
            <p>
                In <em>Macbeth</em>, Shakespeare presents ambition as a double-edged sword.
                Macbeth’s desire for power, fueled by Lady Macbeth and the witches’ prophecy,
                leads him into a cycle of violence and tyranny. The tragedy lies in his
                transformation from a noble warrior into a tyrant consumed by guilt and paranoia.
            </p>

            <h2>Othello: Jealousy and Manipulation</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Othello</em> explores the destructive force of jealousy. Manipulated by Iago,
                Othello’s insecurities about race and trust drive him to murder Desdemona.
                Shakespeare shows how jealousy blinds reason and destroys love.
            </p>

            <h2>King Lear: Pride and Madness</h2>
            <p>
                In <em>King Lear</em>, pride leads to folly and madness. Lear’s decision to divide
                his kingdom based on flattery sets off a chain of betrayal and tragedy.
                The play highlights themes of loyalty, justice, and the fragility of human reason.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Shakespeare’s tragedies endure because they reflect timeless truths about human nature.
                Whether through Hamlet’s hesitation, Macbeth’s ambition, Othello’s jealousy, or Lear’s pride,
                Shakespeare reveals the flaws that make us human. His tragedies continue to resonate,
                teaching us about the dangers of unchecked emotions and desires.
            </p>

            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <h3>Font Choices</h3>
            <p>
                I used <strong>'Merriweather'</strong> for the body text to create a traditional, 
                book-like feeling. For headings, <strong>'Playfair Display'</strong> adds elegance 
                and makes each section stand out. Together, they balance classic and modern design.
            </p>

            <h3>Heading and Text Sizes</h3>
            <p>
                The main title (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is large and bold for prominence. 
                The subheadings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) use a smaller size for hierarchy. 
                Body text is set to 18px for comfort and easy reading.
            </p>

            <h3>Color Choices</h3>
            <p>
                The background blends dark navy and indigo for a regal tone. 
                Text remains light ivory for contrast. Accents like borders and titles 
                use <span style="color:#efb810;">royal gold</span>, symbolizing richness and prestige.
            </p>

            <h3>Margins and Padding</h3>
            <p>
                Generous side margins (10%) and soft padding make the essay feel centered and open. 
                Each paragraph and section is spaced consistently to maintain rhythm while reading.
            </p>

            <h3>HTML Abuse Fixes</h3>
            <p>
                In Lab 2, I had used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the title purely for appearance. 
                I fixed that to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to respect semantic HTML. 
                All visual design is now entirely controlled by CSS.
