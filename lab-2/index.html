    <!-- Main Essay -->
    <article>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            William Shakespeare is regarded as one of the greatest playwrights in history. 
            Among his many works, his tragedies stand out for their deep exploration of human flaws, fate, and ambition. 
            Works such as <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Othello</em>, and <em>King Lear</em> have been studied for centuries due to their universal themes.
        </p>

        <h2>Hamlet: The Struggle with Inaction</h2>
        <p>
            In <em>Hamlet</em>, Shakespeare explores the dangers of hesitation and indecision. 
            Hamlet’s delay in avenging his father’s death reveals the destructive power of excessive reflection. 
            His tragic flaw—indecision—ultimately leads to widespread death and the collapse of Denmark’s royal family.
        </p>

        <h2>Macbeth: Ambition and Power</h2>
        <p>
            In <em>Macbeth</em>, Shakespeare presents ambition as a double-edged sword. 
            Macbeth’s desire for power, fueled by Lady Macbeth and the witches’ prophecy, 
            leads him into a cycle of violence and tyranny. 
            The tragedy lies in his transformation from a noble warrior into a tyrant consumed by guilt and paranoia.
        </p>

        <h2>Othello: Jealousy and Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Othello</em> explores the destructive force of jealousy. 
            Manipulated by Iago, Othello’s insecurities about race and trust drive him to murder Desdemona. 
            Shakespeare shows how jealousy blinds reason and destroys love.
        </p>

        <h2>King Lear: Pride and Madness</h2>
        <p>
            In <em>King Lear</em>, pride leads to folly and madness. 
            Lear’s decision to divide his kingdom based on flattery sets off a chain of betrayal and tragedy. 
            The play highlights themes of loyalty, justice, and the fragility of human reason.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Shakespeare’s tragedies endure because they reflect timeless truths about human nature. 
            Whether through Hamlet’s hesitation, Macbeth’s ambition, Othello’s jealousy, or Lear’s pride, 
            Shakespeare reveals the flaws that make us human. 
            His tragedies continue to resonate, teaching us about the dangers of unchecked emotions and desires.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            In converting this essay into HTML, I chose to use semantic tags for clarity and structure. 
            I used <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to separate the main essay from the addendum. 
            Headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) were used to divide the essay into clear sections, 
            making it easy to navigate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Italics (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) were used for the titles of plays to follow writing conventions. 
            The bibliography was represented as an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) 
            since it is a list of works cited. 
            Finally, I included the required footer script to automatically display the last modified date of the page, 
            as per assignment requirements. 
        </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
